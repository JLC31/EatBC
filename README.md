# EatBC

Find out what's being served on campus!

# App Features

EatBC allows users to see all open dining halls and view their complete menus.

Tapping on the date in the upper-left corner allows the user to view the menu for the current date, as well as several days in advance!

Tap on a dining location and swipe between screens to see the menus for breakfast, lunch, and dinner (late night too)!

Tap on a menu item to see the nutritional information, allergens and more!

# Notice

The items shown on the app are taken directly from campus dining's website. There may be an item that is shown on the app that is not available in the dining location (or vice versa). Be aware that items are subject to change.

# Contact Information
