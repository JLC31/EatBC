# EatBC

Find out what's being served on campus!

EatBC allows users to see all open dining halls and view their complete menus. By tapping on a location and swiping between screens, users can see the menus for breakfast, lunch, and dinner (late night too)!

Tapping on a menu item allows the user to see the nutritional information, allergens and more!
